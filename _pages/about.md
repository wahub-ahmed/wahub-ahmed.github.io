Hey there, I'm glad you stopped by my page! Your journey through the internet must have been tiring, so help yourself to some :coffee:

### About Me
I am a Computer Science Major at Haverford College, involved in Software Engineering, Data Engineering, and Data Science. But really, I innovate ways to learn from and communicate with people. We are our own datasets afterall.

I enjoy exploring nature trails, open water swimming, weightlifting, and repairing old technology in my spare time.
